# Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks for Matching Image and Sentence


[](ICCV2015.pdf)

## Model

It consists of one image CNN encoding the **image content** and one matching CNN modeling **the joint representation of image and sentence**.

The matching CNN composes **different semantic fragments** from words and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the matching relations between image and sentence. 

## Task
(m-CNNs) for matching image and sentence.

bidirectional image and sentence retrieval on the Flickr8K and Flickr30K datasets.
